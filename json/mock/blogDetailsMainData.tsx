          My name is Katie, I'm a licensed esthetician and certified acne
          expert! My personal struggles with acne throughout high school and
          college triggered my passion into skincare. I would research every
          ingredient in a skincare product before I applied it to my skin.
          Countless days and nights trying to figure out what products worked
          and didn't work on my skin. I became devoted to researching skincare
          ingredients, products, brands, estheticians, etc. and I knew that this
          was something that would be in my life forever. After 3 years of
          working in a corporate marketing job, I knew I wasn't reaching my full
          potential and that I needed to follow my heart. After full support
          from my family and friends, I made the leap to transition into
          becoming an esthetician. I always dreamed of helping people who were
          in similar situations to me with their skin. Enabling somebody with
          knowledge on how to achieve healthy and clear skin is so rewarding and
          reminds me why I became an esthetician. I love helping people attain
          their skincare goals and watching them grow confident in their bare
          skin.My main area of expertise is treating acne.

          Since dealing with it myself for so many years, I understand the
          struggle and desire to be clear. My acne treatments consist of a
          3-month minimum boot camp treatments, as well as taking home a brand
          new skincare routine. I always take progress photos so that we can
          look back at where we started and show off how far we've come. After
          my clients finish their acne treatments, I suggest Procell treatments
          to help with residual scarring or hyperpigmentation.

          During these Procell treatments, a client is numbed for ultimate
          comfortability, once that is removed I proceed by applying the Procell
          stem cell serum to the skin, working in sections. I start most of my
          clients off with a 0.25 microchannel depth and begin the service.
          After the microchanneling is finished, I apply one last layer of stem
          cell serum, drape a cooling and hydrating sheet mask over the skin,
          and place a red LED light over the client for 20 minutes.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          The Procell treatments are so relaxing that most of my clients feel no
          irritation at all, they usually take a nap! I also offer Procell
          treatments on stretch marks!It's so fulfilling when a client
          originally comes to me and is unhappy with how their skin looks but
          we're able to partner together and achieve healthy skin. I love having
          clients trust me with their skin. Following my dream and passion to
          become an esthetician and start my own business was truly the best
          career decision I've ever made. This industry is so supportive of one
          another and there are always new technologies and products coming out.
          If anyone out there is thinking about leaving the "safe option" to
          follow their dream, this is your sign. It can be intimidating at
          first, but I believe if you truly feel passionate about it you can
          achieve it. Thank you to all my clients for trusting me and working
          with me, I love you!

        It has always been a dream of mine since I was a little girl to help
        others feel pretty in their own skin. My focus is not to only treat the
        skin topically with high-quality products and skin treatments but to
        also feed the body internally with what it needs. I graduated from
        cosmetology school in 2004 and began my career in a hair salon. Shortly
        after beginning my career as a hairstylist, I developed celiac disease
        and during this time of my life, I had struggled with cystic acne pretty
        bad caused by the celiacs which led me to my passion, skin.
        <br />I realized when I was only doing hair that something was missing
        and just wanted more. Jump forward to 2010 when MAC’s Lash & Skin Studio
        was established. I am incredibly passionate about helping others feel
        beautiful on the inside and out. My skin journey was self-taught because
        back in 2004 no one knew anything about celiacs and how the gut
        contributed to skin health so I learned how to listen to my body and
        feed it what it needed with natural organic foods and good skin products
        topically and learning what treatments work best for the skin that
        provides results. This personal experience helped me to learn how to
        help treat my clients on a whole new level. Being a results-driven
        esthetician, my goal is to give my clients the best skin that they have
        always dreamt it to be. I do not only treat the skin topically but I
        treat it as a whole inside and out and figure out what the underlying
        problem is internally with a process of elimination that could be an
        underlying contributor causing acne or skin concerns. My specialty is
        treating acne and reversing aging. Finding Procell at a skin show in
        Philadelphia, PA many years ago was one of the best things that happened
        for me personally and for treating my clients. Microchanneling is hands
        down one of my absolute favorite skin treatments and provides incredible
        results for both acne and anti-aging. Being one of the top requested
        treatments at MAC’s, this is one of our clients' favorite go-to
        treatments.

        I received my first treatment and I was sold!! The compliments that I
        received on my skin immediately in the following days were incredible.
        The plump and the glow that my skin had was what did it for me and then
        to see the results it was providing my skin with continued use I knew
        this was a lifetime treatment I would forever love. Seeing how many
        clients' skin that my team and I have transformed over the years is one
        of the best feelings. When our clients come to us with skin issues,
        wanting to reverse aging, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation, or to
        prevent aging this is our number one go-to. To see the happiness on
        their faces as we are working to heal and repair… is the most rewarding!
        <br />
        Some of the benefits of this treatment are collagen production plumping
        the skin, reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, a brighter complexion,
        improved skin texture, reduction of acne and acne scarring, and a boost
        in self-esteem with more youthful skin!
        <br />
        This 30-minute treatment has minimal discomfort and leaves your skin
        with a little redness and feels like a mild sunburn for the first 24
        hours. But also, your skin feels plump, lifted, tight, and toned. Over
        the next weeks, you will continue to see results and your skin will
        glow.
        <br />I have so many! One of my most memorable though is how I
        transformed a young girl that had cystic acne and scarring to have
        beautiful clear, bright skin with no scarring. Watching her confidence
        go from nothing to everything has been one of my most rewarding
        experiences so far! Her smile says it all!!
        <br />
        Your skin is your largest and one of the most important organs. Nourish
        it well with all the healthiest foods internally and the cleanest
        products topically! Treat your skin every 4 weeks to reverse/prevent any
        skin issues and you will love the skin your in. Not only for skin health
        but also for mental health. When you feel good in the skin your mind
        will feel good also!
