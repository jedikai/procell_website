            founded Procell Therapies in 2013 with a bold vision. During his 30+
            years as a practicing dermatologist he had observed the limitations
            and damage caused by other anti-aging systems. Dr. Schwartz realized
            that with some engineering and ingenuity he could provide better
            results in a safe and non-invasive way.

            Thanks to our roots in dermatology practice, we know what it takes
            to successfully adopt a new treatment technology. Thatâ€™s why Procell
